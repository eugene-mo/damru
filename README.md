## 📡 Platform Recommendation: Redroid vs MuMu

While Damru technically lists multiple environments, **Redroid (Docker)** is the only officially supported and functional path.

| Platform | Status | Stealth Level | Stability | Recommendation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Redroid (Docker)** | **Production-Ready** | **Absolute** | **High** | **Highly Recommended** |
| **MuMu Player** | **Unfinished / Beta** | Moderate | Low | **Non-functional / Not Recommended** |
| **Physical Devices** | **NOT SUPPORTED** | N/A | N/A | **DO NOT USE** |

> [!CAUTION]
> **Physical Device Warning**
> Damru is designed strictly for containerized environments (Redroid). **It does not support physical Android devices.** Do not attempt to run Damru against your personal phone. If you choose to use a spare rooted device, you do so at your own risk. Damru's low-level OS patches and binary injections may brick or destabilize physical hardware.

**Why Redroid?**
Damru's most advanced stealth layers—including native GPU binary patching and OS-level `iptables` hooks—are optimized for the Redroid kernel. It provides a more stable environment for multi-container pools and is significantly more undetectable by modern anti-bot heuristics. MuMu Player support is currently an experimental, unfinished, and non-functional beta feature.

## 🥊 Why Damru is Better Than the Rest

We spent significant time modifying and testing popular desktop-first solutions like **Camoufox**, **Fingerprinting Chromium**, and various Playwright stealth patches to work on mobile—but nothing reached the level of stability and undetectability achieved by this project. 

The botting landscape is littered with tools that *used* to work: `puppeteer-stealth`, `undetected-chromedriver`, and various anti-detect browsers. Here is why they fail today, and why Damru succeeds:

| Feature | Legacy Tools (`puppeteer-stealth`, etc.) | Damru |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Spoofing Method** | **JavaScript Injection** (`Object.defineProperty`). Leaves massive detectable traces. | **Native Overrides**. Modifies C++ engine via CDP, patches binaries, edits OS props. |
| **JS Leakage** | Anti-bots check `.toString()` on functions. Injected JS is caught instantly. | **Zero JS Injected**. Functions remain entirely native. |
| **Hardware Emulation** | Fakes `navigator.hardwareConcurrency` via JS. Fails worker tests. | **C++ CDP Override**. Changes the value at the Chromium engine level. Passes all tests. |
| **GPU Fingerprint** | WebGL spoofing via JS wrapping. Leaks real GPU via extensions. | **Binary Patching**. Physically patches the `.so` Vulkan/GLES driver files on Android. |
| **Physical Memory** | Fakes `deviceMemory` via JS. Easily caught by timing or syscall checks. | **Syscall Hooks**. Uses `libfakemem.so` to intercept `sysinfo` calls via `LD_PRELOAD`. |
| **Worker Stealth** | Workers often leak the real hardware concurrency of the host. | **Worker Interception**. Uses CDP `Target.setAutoAttach` to force overrides on all Threads/Workers. |
| **TLS/JA3 Hash** | Fixed TLS fingerprint based on the Chrome binary version. | **TLS Randomization**. Produces ~184 unique JA3 hashes via dynamic cipher blacklisting. |
| **Screen Dimensions** | Viewing desktop Chrome as mobile via viewport scaling (leaks real screen size). | **OS-Level Display**. Modifies Android `wm size/density` natively. |
| **Network Identity** | Frequently leaks WebRTC private IPs and IPv6 fingerprints. | **OS-Level IP Tables**. Blocks WebRTC leaks and IPv6 at the Android kernel level. |
| **Mobile Emulation** | Desktop Chrome pretending to be mobile via viewport scaling. | **Real Android OS**. Runs inside Redroid (Android 14) or MuMu Player. It *is* mobile. |

### 📊 Proof of Stealth: Benchmark Comparisons

We regularly test Damru against the hardest anti-bot systems in the industry. These results are reproducible using the built-in benchmark suite (`python -m damru.benchmark`) or the comprehensive functional test suite (`python example.py`).

| Target Anti-Bot | Standard Playwright | Typical Stealth Plugins | Damru |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CreepJS (Trust)** | 0% (Trash) | ~45% (High Lies) | **85%+ (0% Lies, Top Stealth)** |
| **BrowserScan** | Fails Hardware/OS | Fails WebGL/Fonts | **Passes 100% OS/Hardware/WebRTC** |
| **Sannysoft** | Fails | Passes | **Passes 100%** |
| **Cloudflare Turnstile**| Blocked ("Just a moment")| Frequently Blocked | **Bypassed Natively** |
| **Other Enterprise WAFs**| Blocked | Frequently Blocked | **Bypassed Natively** |

*Note: Damru is capable of bypassing many other advanced detection systems not listed here. As an educational project, we focus on demonstrating these core industry-standard benchmarks.*

## 🧠 Architecture: The 8 Layers of "Zero JS" Stealth

Damru's core philosophy is **Zero JavaScript Injection**. Instead of trying to outsmart anti-bot JavaScript *with* more JavaScript, Damru lies from the outside in.

1.  **Layer 1: Android System Props (Root `resetprop`)**
    Damru connects via ADB and uses root access to modify `build.prop` values dynamically. It changes `ro.product.model`, `ro.build.fingerprint`, and the Android SDK version at the OS level. The browser sees a genuine Pixel 8 Pro or Samsung S24.
2.  **Layer 2: GPU Binary Patching**
    Anti-bots actively check your GPU. Generic Docker containers show "SwiftShader" (an instant ban). Damru physically patches the Vulkan/GLES `.so` binaries on the filesystem *before* Chrome launches, reading as an `Adreno (TM) 640` or `Mali-G710`.
3.  **Layer 3: Syscall Interception (`LD_PRELOAD`)**
    Damru uses a custom C shared library (`libfakemem.so`) to intercept the `sysinfo` and `sysconf` system calls. This ensures that even low-level system checks see the spoofed RAM and CPU specifications of the targeted device.
4.  **Layer 4: Deep CDP Protocol Overrides**
    Damru uses low-level Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) commands (`Emulation.setHardwareConcurrencyOverride`, `Emulation.setTouchEmulationEnabled`) to spoof CPU cores and touch points directly inside Chromium's C++ engine.
5.  **Layer 5: Thread & Worker Interception**
    Using `Target.setAutoAttach`, Damru ensures that every Worker (Dedicated, Shared, and Service) created by the browser inherits the same hardware overrides as the main thread, closing a common leakage vector for advanced anti-bots.
6.  **Layer 6: Chrome Preferences & Flag Patching**
    Damru modifies Chrome's underlying `Preferences` JSON and launch flags to force specific Locales, randomize TLS cipher suites (~184 JA3 variants), and disable DNS-over-HTTPS to force resolution through proxy ISP DNS.
7.  **Layer 7: OS-Level Evasions**
    Using Android `iptables`, Damru blocks WebRTC private IP leaks and completely disables IPv6. It also neutralizes DevTools timing detection by bypassing `debugger` pauses natively via CDP.
8.  **Layer 8: Display & Density Spoofing (`wm size/density`)**
    To avoid "Resolution Mismatch" detections, Damru modifies the Android Window Manager natively. It uses `wm size` and `wm density` to force the OS to report physically accurate screen dimensions and pixel densities for the targeted device (e.g., Pixel 8's 1344x2992 @560dpi).

## 💾 Download Custom OS Image

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The pre-baked Damru OS image is **2.3 GB**. Due to its size, it is hosted externally on Google Drive.

**Download the latest image here:**
👉 **[Download damru-redroid-latest.tar](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1na6YYHbpvDlaXhicg_nAKiaMFaYRN99U/view?usp=sharing)**

Once downloaded, follow **Step 3** in the Deployment Guide below to load it into Docker.

---

## 🚀 First-Time User Deployment Guide (WSL2 / Linux)

Ready to start? Damru uses **Redroid** (Android in Docker) to spin up headless mobile devices instantly. Follow this step-by-step guide to deploy Damru from scratch on Ubuntu/Debian or WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux).

### Step 1: System Preparation (Linux / WSL2)

You need a Linux environment. If you are on Windows, install WSL2 (Ubuntu). Ensure your system is up to date and install `adb`:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install adb wget curl git jq -y
```

### Step 2: Install Docker & Enable Binderfs (Crucial for Redroid)

Redroid requires Docker and Android's `binderfs` kernel modules. 

1.  **Install Docker**:
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
    sudo sh get-docker.sh
    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
    ```
    *(Log out and log back in, or run `newgrp docker` to apply permissions).*

2.  **Mount Binderfs** (Required for Android inside Docker):
    ```bash
    sudo mkdir -p /dev/binderfs
    sudo mount -t binder binder /dev/binderfs
    ```
    *(Note: To make this persistent across reboots, you will need to add it to `/etc/fstab`).*

### 🪄 The Instant Custom OS Image

Compiling native C binaries, injecting them via ADB, applying `iptables` rules, and installing Chrome on every run is a long process. **The Instant Solution:** We provide a pre-baked OS image ([damru-redroid-latest.tar](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1na6YYHbpvDlaXhicg_nAKiaMFaYRN99U/view?usp=sharing)) where all native patches, TTS engines, and specific Chrome APKs are **already baked in**. This turns a complex 5-minute setup into an instant plug-and-play boot!

### Step 3: Instant Boot with the Custom OS (Recommended)

1.  **Load the pre-baked image**:
    
    **For WSL2 Users:** (Assuming `.tar` is in your Windows Downloads folder)
    ```bash
    docker load -i /mnt/c/Users/YourUsername/Downloads/damru-redroid-latest.tar
    ```
    
    **For Native Linux Users:**
    ```bash
    docker load -i damru-redroid-latest.tar
    ```

2.  **Start the custom Damru container**:
    ```bash
    docker run -itd --rm --privileged \
        -v ~/data:/data \
        -p 5555:5555 \
        damru-redroid:latest \
        androidboot.redroid_width=1080 \
        androidboot.redroid_height=2400 \
        androidboot.redroid_dpi=480
    ```

Wait 30 seconds for Android to boot, then connect via ADB:
```bash
adb connect localhost:5555
adb devices
# You should see: localhost:5555 device
```

> [!TIP]
> **What is an ADB Serial?**
> An ADB serial is a unique identifier for your Android device. 
> - For **Redroid/Docker**, it is usually the network address: `localhost:5555` or an internal IP.
> - For **Physical Devices**, it is a hardware string like `9889d6444b49` (visible via `adb devices`).

### Step 4: Install Damru

**Option A: Direct Pip Install (Fastest)**
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/akwin1234/damru.git
playwright install
```

#### 🛠️ Windows Installation Fix (Important)

If you are using Windows (especially Python 3.10) and encounter an `AssertionError: ...distutils\core.py` during `pip install`, you must force standard distutils. Run this in your terminal *before* installing:

```powershell
# PowerShell (Run this first!)
$env:SETUPTOOLS_USE_DISTUTILS="stdlib"

# Then run:
pip install git+https://github.com/akwin1234/damru.git
```

**Option B: Clone & Install (For Developers)**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/akwin1234/damru.git
cd damru
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
playwright install
```

*(Magic Note: When you import Damru, it automatically patches Playwright's source code (`crPage.js`) on your system to prevent CDP target discovery leaks!)*

---

## ⚙️ Global Configuration

Damru uses a centralized configuration file located at `damru/config.py`. If you clone the repository or install it locally, you should modify these settings before running large pools or automated scripts.

> [!TIP]
> **Pre-made Configurations Available!**
> We have provided OS-specific configuration templates in the `damru/` directory to get you started faster:
> - **Windows / WSL2**: Copy `damru/config.py.windows` and rename it to `config.py`.
> - **Native Linux**: Copy `damru/config.py.linux` and rename it to `config.py`.

### 🔑 Essential Configurations

1. **WSL2 Sudo Authentication (Windows Auto-Mode)**:
   If you are running Python on Windows and orchestrating Docker containers inside WSL2, Damru needs to execute `sudo docker` commands automatically.
   ```python
   # damru/config.py
   WSL_DISTRO = "Ubuntu"
   WSL_USERNAME = "YOUR_WSL_USERNAME_HERE"
   WSL_PASSWORD = "YOUR_WSL_PASSWORD_HERE"  # Required to bypass sudo prompts
   ```

2. **Chrome APK Path**:
   When not using the pre-baked `.tar` image, Damru will dynamically install Chrome onto raw Redroid instances. Point it to your APK directory.
   ```python
   # None = auto-searches the 'chrome-apks/' directory in the project root
   CHROME_APK = None  
   # Or specify an absolute path:
   # CHROME_APK = "/mnt/c/path/to/damru/chrome-apks/145.0.7632.75"
   ```

3. **Pool Settings (`NUM_DEVICES` & `MODE`)**:
   ```python
   MODE = "auto"          # "auto" = manages Docker containers; "mumu" = local VMs; "manual" = ADB
   NUM_DEVICES = 10       # How many concurrent containers to spin up/maintain
   REDROID_IMAGE = "damru-redroid:latest"  # The Docker image to use
   ```

### 🐋 Docker Storage Location (Crucial for Windows Users)
Redroid containers consume significant disk space. If you are using WSL2 Docker, it saves data to your `ext4.vhdx` virtual drive on the `C:` drive by default, which can quickly fill up your primary SSD.

**To save Docker images to a secondary HDD:**
You must configure the Docker daemon inside WSL to use a different data-root.
1. Open WSL (`wsl -d Ubuntu`).
2. Stop docker: `sudo service docker stop`.
3. Move existing data to your HDD: `sudo mv /var/lib/docker /mnt/d/docker-data`.
4. Symlink it back: `sudo ln -s /mnt/d/docker-data /var/lib/docker`.
5. Start docker: `sudo service docker start`.

*(Note: Native `DOCKER_STORAGE_PATH` configuration via Python is on the upcoming roadmap).*

---

## 💻 Usage & Examples

Damru handles the heavy lifting: it connects to ADB, gains root, applies system patches, spoofs the GPU, launches Chrome, and attaches via CDP—all automatically.

### Example 1: Basic Async Usage (The Standard Way)

```python
import asyncio
from damru import AsyncDamru

async def main():
    print("Launching Damru...")
    
    # device="random" picks from our database of 32+ real Android devices.
    # proxy is used to auto-resolve Timezone and Locale!
    async with AsyncDamru(
        device="random", 
        proxy="socks5://your.proxy.ip:1080",
        debug=True
    ) as browser:
        
        # 'browser' is a standard Playwright BrowserContext!
        page = await browser.new_page()
        
        print("Navigating to CreepJS to test stealth...")
        await page.goto("https://abrahamjuliot.github.io/creepjs/")
        await page.wait_for_timeout(10000)
        await page.screenshot(path="creepjs_score.png")
        print("Done! Check creepjs_score.png")

asyncio.run(main())
```

### Example 2: Synchronous Usage

If you prefer synchronous code, Damru provides a blocking wrapper:

```python
from damru import Damru

def run_sync():
    with Damru(device="pixel_8_pro") as browser:
        page = browser.new_page()
        page.goto("https://bot.sannysoft.com/")
        page.wait_for_timeout(5000)
        page.screenshot(path="sannysoft.png")
        print("Passed Sannysoft!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    run_sync()
```

### Example 3: Scaling Up with Connection Pooling

Scraping thousands of pages? Damru provides a native Pool manager to run operations concurrently across multiple Docker containers.

```python
from damru import DamruPoolSync

proxies = [
    "socks5://proxy1:1080",
    "socks5://proxy2:1080",
    "socks5://proxy3:1080"
]

with DamruPoolSync(size=3, proxy_list=proxies) as pool:
    for i, context in enumerate(pool.get_contexts()):
        page = context.new_page()
        page.goto("https://example.com/api/scrape_target")
        print(f"Worker {i} finished scraping: {page.title()}")
```

---

## 🧪 Testing Your Setup

Damru ships with a comprehensive benchmark suite. Run it to ensure your setup is truly undetectable.

```bash
# Run all benchmark tests on a random device
python -m damru.benchmark --device random

# Run specific tests with a proxy
python -m damru.benchmark --device samsung_galaxy_s24_ultra --proxy socks5://ip:port --tests creepjs cloudflare
```

---

## 🗺️ The "Big Plan" (Roadmap)

We are aggressively building Damru into a fully autonomous infrastructure tool. Check `docs/AUTOMATION_GAPS_PLAN.md` for details.

*   [ ] **`damru setup` CLI**: Single-command installation for Docker and `binderfs`.
*   [ ] **Auto Image Management**: Damru will dynamically bake "Damru-Ready" Docker images natively.
*   [ ] **Automated Health Checks**: One-click verification of ADB, kernel config, and Playwright patches.
*   [ ] **Mass Orchestration**: Expanding `DamruPool` for Kubernetes/Swarm deployment.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### 1. Does Damru support physical Android devices?
**No.** Damru is designed strictly for containerized environments (Redroid). Its low-level OS patches, `resetprop` logic, and binary driver injections are optimized for Redroid's kernel and filesystem. **Do not attempt to use Damru on your personal phone.** If you use a spare rooted device, you do so entirely at your own risk.

### 2. Can I use MuMu Player instead of Docker?
MuMu Player support is currently an **experimental, unfinished, and non-functional beta feature**. While the code structure for it exists, we highly recommend using **Redroid (Docker)** for any production or serious research work.

### 3. Why is the .tar image so large?
The `damru-redroid-latest.tar` image (2.3 GB) is a full Android 14 operating system. It includes pre-installed Chrome, 30+ TTS voices, custom fonts, and pre-patched binary drivers to ensure instant deployment and maximum stealth.

### 4. Does Damru work on native Linux?
**Yes.** Any Docker image built in WSL2 is a standard Linux image. Damru works perfectly on native Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, etc.), provided the `binder` kernel modules are loaded.

### 5. Why "Zero JS Injection"?
Standard stealth tools are caught by anti-bots because their JavaScript injections leave traces (timing, prototype pollution). Damru lies from the outside-in (OS, Binary, and Protocol levels), making it mathematically invisible to scripts.
